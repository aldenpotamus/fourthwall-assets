    <p>Balrdur’s Gate 3 is just one of those games… as a player of the original Baldur’s Gate and its sequel this game
      is everything I dreamt of and more. Larian Studios have brought D&D to life if a way I didn’t know was possible
      and I’m here for it. Viewership is terrible, but it’s a game I will finish simply because it brings me joy.</p>

    <p>Balatro is a game I’ve been obsessed with watching others play for as long as it’s been around. This poker
      roguelite is all about making the best hands with a multiplicative points system that can get truly out of hand.
      Modified Cards, Game Changing Jokers and many other mechanics round out a surprisingly deep roguelike that came
      out of nowhere and captured everyone’s attention.</p>

    <p>SpellRogue is an early access title with a staggering amount of potential. It blends roguelite elements with a
      dice driven Slay the Spire-esc experience that is both rewarding and engaging. There’s already a lot of content

  <div class="gamecard_text">
    <p>Ring of Pain is a game I wasn’t sure I’d love, but my skepticism was not warranted. This unique entry in the
      roguelite genre is refreshingly quirky and surprisingly deep and challenging. As the player you navigate a series
      of rings consisting of gear, stat upgrades and mostly monsters fighting your way deeper and deeper.</p>

    <p>Hailing all the way from 1999 this absolute classic is not to be underestimated. My discord community had been
      rabidly advocating for me to play this title for ages, and when I finally picked it up I understood why. While the
      graphics may harken back to another time, the strategic nuance of the game was ahead of its time, and I’m really
      enjoying catching up on one I missed.</p>

  <div class="gamecard_text">
    <p>Against the Storm is a vibe, this combat-free colony builder is all about pitting you against the unrelenting
      drizzle. Few games manage to create so much ambiance while also creating solid strategic depth, learning the
      production pathways needed to create a thriving colony is fun and rewarding. There’s an incredibly deep
      meta-progression system that will continue adding complexity to the game as long as you’re interested in playing.

  <div class="gamecard_text">
    <p>Cobalt Core, while not as mechanically similar to FTL as it is in its art style, this space-based roguelite
      brings some new ideas to the table. Offering up a 2D battlefield your ship must strafe across, a host of pilots
      that radically change your starting deck, and a story that is endearing and quirky. This title brings a lot of
      nice things to the table and every time I play I’m pleasantly surprised by its twists and turns.</p>

    <p>What’s with me enjoying games that operate on a 2D plane, I’m starting to worry maybe the 3rd dimension isn’t for
      me… Shogun Showdown brings a lot of fun mechanics to the table, this roguelite has limited meta progression but a
      rather deep library of achievements that all center around queue-ing up actions and then watching your hero do
      exactly as they’ve been instructed, for better or worse. The latest update added a lot of difficulty to this
      already enjoyable title.</p>
